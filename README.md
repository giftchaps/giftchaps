  <h1>Hi, I’m Gift Chapfuradombo 👋</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Junior Cloud Security & Automation Engineer</strong><br>
    I automate security workflows, identify cloud misconfigurations, and explore
    detection techniques through hands-on projects and applied research.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently completing an M.S. in Cybersecurity at the University of New Haven.
    Most of my learning happens outside the classroom—building tools, running labs,
    and documenting security problems end-to-end.

## 🔒 What I’m Actually Working On

These projects reflect what I can **build, analyze, and clearly explain**, including
hands-on labs and research work.

### 🛡️ Thread Pulse AI
**Automated threat intelligence aggregation & alerting**

- Built an automation workflow to collect, filter, and summarize threat intelligence
- Reduced manual monitoring of security feeds and advisories
- Focused on signal > noise using structured parsing and scheduling
- Designed for extension into SOC-style alerting and reporting pipelines

---

### 🔍 AWS Security & Misconfiguration Labs
**Hands-on cloud security practice**

- Deployed AWS environments to study real-world misconfigurations
- Practiced IAM hardening, least-privilege access, and logging concepts
- Used tools like **Prowler** and manual inspection to identify security gaps
- Documented findings and remediation steps

---

### 🔐 DeceptiCloud
**Cloud deception & adversary detection research (in progress)**

- Conducted academic research on **deception techniques in cloud environments**
- Explored the use of **decoy resources, deceptive services, and false signals**
  to detect and mislead attackers
- Designed a conceptual architecture for a **cloud-based deception layer**
  inspired by honeypots and honeynets
- Analyzed integration with logging, alerting, and threat detection workflows
- Documented limitations, open challenges, and future work
  (automation, scalability, false positives)

> This project was research-focused and exploratory. It strengthened my understanding
> of attacker behavior in cloud environments and how deception can complement
> traditional defensive controls.

---

### 🧪 Web Security Labs
**Offensive awareness with a defensive mindset**

- Tested intentionally vulnerable applications (DVWA / Juice Shop–style labs)
- Explored common vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL injection, and misconfigurations
- Focused on understanding attack paths and mitigation strategies
- Produced structured notes and reports rather than “point-and-shoot” exploitation

---

### ⚙️ Automation & Scripting
**Reducing repetitive security work**

- Python scripts for data processing, reporting, and automation
- Workflow automation using tools like n8n
- Emphasis on clarity, reliability, and documentation

---

## 🧠 Skills I Can Defend

- **Cloud Fundamentals** — AWS basics, IAM, VPCs, logging
- **Security Concepts** — Misconfigurations, least privilege, threat awareness
- **Automation** — Python scripting, workflow automation
- **Tooling** — Prowler, Linux, Git, basic SIEM concepts

---

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Deepening **cloud security fundamentals**
- Preparing for **CompTIA Security+**
- Building **internship-ready projects**, not random experiments
